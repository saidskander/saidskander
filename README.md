### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**saidskander/saidskander** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

ğŸŒ± My name is Skander Amireche, I'm a Software engineering student at Holberton School and an Artist.
âœ¨ I decided to dive into the TECH world.
ğŸŒ± I have been studying low-level programming, high-level programming, system engineering and devops, and web stack programming (Front-end & Back-end) using a methodology based on peer-learning and projects.
âœ¨ I'm curious, adaptable, a fast learner and I love developing my skills.
